                I got my start in the tech industry in 2020 when I enrolled in Hack Reactor, an Immersive Software
                Engineering Bootcamp. It was the best career choice I ever made! I seek out and thrive in
                environments
                where I'm intellectually stimulated, and software development provides just that, because the
                learning never ends.

                I'm a problem solver, I love tinkering with systems, figuring out how they work, and solving
                problems.

                I'm a science and space junkie. I love reading about the latest discoveries being made and am
                constantly
                amazed by advances in technology. Being able to see back 13.7 billion years with the JWST is mind
                boggling.

                have
                eggs, get a dozen.' The programmer goes to the store and returns home with 12 loaves of bread. 'They

                eggs,' he explained."

                And
                along the way, lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you." - NDT
